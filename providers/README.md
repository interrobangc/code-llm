# CodeLLM Providers

The providers are a standard interface for various LLM providers. The system currently supports:

- [langchain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/) providers. This is a wrapper around langchain that allows you to use any of the available LLMs.
- [mistral](https://mistral-api.com/) providers. You will need to configure an API key for the mistral API.
- [ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- [openai](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python) providers. You will need to have ollama running locally or configure an API key for openai.
