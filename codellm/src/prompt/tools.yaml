  - name: CyclomaticComplexityTool
    description:
      This tool analyzes a codebase, focusing on the cyclomatic complexity
      of Python files. It can take a user's question, assess files by complexity, and
      sort the results by average or max complexity to provide insights into the most
      complicated parts of the codebase.
    base_prompt:
      Your task is to provide a summary of the cyclomatic complexity for
      the most complex files in the codebase.
